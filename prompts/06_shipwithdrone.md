The clear blue sea stretches wide before the low hill on the left, the low hill on the right, and the small hill in the center.
The sky is clear with many large clouds.

Two-story floating house with glass windows,
integrated roof design: starting from the left side, the roof rises in a gentle half-arch from the left edge of the house floor, then flattens out at the center.
Small radar unit positioned between the right side and the center.

A white lamp shaped like a drone, composed of four directions.
Each direction features a concave lamp recessed into its structure, forming a circular arrangement.
The overall shape is semi-elliptical.
This lamp is suspended in the air, connected to the house by wires.
