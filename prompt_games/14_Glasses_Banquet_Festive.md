Three wine glasses are clustered on a brown table, not arranged in a straight line, each of a different size.
To the left of the wine glasses is a light green liquor in a transparent glass bottle.
Behind the wine glasses is a bowl containing green vegetables and a wooden spoon.
Other bowls are also placed, each holding contents.
The bowls are all arranged in different sections.
One of these bowls is placed at the very front.
The wine glasses, liquor, and vegetable bowl are all placed on a patterned white tablecloth.
The background has a bar atmosphere, dark with light shining from lamps.
Front view, with focus on the wine glasses, making the areas behind and in front blurry. Actual photo.
