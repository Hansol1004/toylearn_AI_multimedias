

```
A deep orange sunset sky, a large full moon in the upper left, a few puffy clouds
At the far right, a large, withered tree with spiderwebs between its branches.
The ground is dry grassland, scattered with Halloween pumpkins.
A woman in a witch's costume is flying upward on a broomstick. She is positioned directly at the center of the full moon.
Bats are flying in a single line from the full moon toward the tree, moving in a downward-right direction.
The woman, tree, grassy field, pumpkins, and bats are all rendered with black shading.
Cartoon animation style.
